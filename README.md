# Multi-Cycle-Processor-Design

Designed a multi-cycle processor using VHDL that could successfully execute 14 different 16-bit
instructions which together can perform any general task regardless of complexity.

Implemented the instructions in the form of a finite state machine with several overlapping states
between instructions, helping lower the complexity of the design and simulated it on Quartus
